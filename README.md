# Cash Register Project

This project is a functional cash register application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input the amount of cash provided by a customer, calculates the change due, and updates the cash drawer accordingly. The app dynamically handles different currency denominations and provides alerts when there are insufficient funds or if the payment is exact.

## Features

- **Calculate Change**: Automatically calculates and displays the change due based on the customer payment and the price of the item.
- **Cash Drawer Update**: Dynamically updates the cash drawer with the remaining cash after each transaction.
- **Alerts**: Provides alerts when the cash given is less than the price, or when exact cash is provided.
- **Responsive Design**: User-friendly and designed to work on all screen sizes.

## Learning Outcomes

In this project, I gained experience with:

- **DOM Manipulation**: Displaying real-time updates for the change due and the current state of the cash drawer.
- **Event Handling**: Processing user interactions, such as clicking the purchase button and entering cash amounts.
- **Currency Denomination Logic**: Handling different currency denominations and calculating the correct change.
